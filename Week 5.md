## ***1. Emerging market crisis***
> Definitions
  - Financial Crisis: A sudden decline in confidence in relation to the government/central bank and banking sector ability to respect its liabilities(on the committed terms)
    - Banking crisis: actual or potential bank runs or failures that induce banks to suspend the internal convertibility of their liabilities
    - Public debt crisis: situation in which a government cannot service its foreign and/or domestic obligations
    - Balance of payment crisis => Currency crisis
      - BOM crisis: a structural misbalance between a deficit on the current account (absorption) and capital and financial accounts (sources of financing) that, after exhausting international reserves, leads to a currency crisis
      - Currency crisis: a sudden decline in confidence in a given currency

> Twin or triple crises
  - Banking crisis => public debt crisis
  - Banking crisis => currency crisis
  - Public debt crisis => banking crisis
  - Public debt crisis => currency crisis
  - Currency crisis => banking crisis
  - Currency crisis => public debt crisis

> Causes of banking crises
  - Credit boom or imprudent lending => large share of non-performing assets
  - Currency mismatches
  - Large potfolio of government securities
  - Confidence crisis
  - Sudden outflow of capital

> Cause of public debt crises
  - Imprudent fiscal polices
  - But it is difficult to estimate the exact thresholds of default risks

> Factors detemining default risk
  - debt level
  - debt dynamics; if it grows rapidly it will create an additional risk factor;
  - outstanding debt maturity; if it is short it can cause problems with debt rollover;
  - availability of liquid financial assets, i.e., the difference between gross and net debt
  - the share of non-residents among creditors; their high share may increase risk of their sudden exit from government bond market exit in the case of global or regional crisis;
  - the share of short-term investors among creditors (which also increase the risk of their sudden outflow the case of adverse shock);
  - the share of the debt liabilities denominated in foreign currency (important in case of currency depreciation)
  - the presence of the contingent liabilities, expecially in the banking and financial systems;
  - country's financial reputation (past episodes of defaults, high inflation and hyperinflation, banking crises, stability and reliability of the national currency, etc);
  - political stability and political ability of taking decisions necessary for fiscal consolidation, predictability of country's economic policy; 
  - tax potential of the country;
  - availability of non-tax sources of revenue, including rent revenue related to natural resources;
  - level of financial market development and its liquidity;
  - external demand for country's sovereign debt and other financial instruments and the international role of national currency;
  - situation on international financial markets; changes in global liquidity, changes in investors' mood, their response to unexpected shocks

> Causes of currency crises
  - First-generation model (Krugman, Flood & Garber): inconsistency between the exchange-rate peg and expansionary macroeconomic policy (fiscal and monetary) + speculation
  - Second-generation model (Obstfeld): uncertainty in respect to government's economic priorities (multiple equilibria)
  - Third-generation model (McKinnon & Phil, Krugman): private over-borrowing creates implicit public liabilities (of central bank and government) leading monetary and fiscal expansion (+ multiple equilibria)

> Role of exogenous shocks
  - Domestic: e.g., political crisis
  - External: increase of international interest rates (early 1980s), changes in major exchange rates (1990s), trade and price shocks, conflicts
  - Crisis spillover: trade and financial links
  - Contagion effect (expectations, herd behavior)

> Episodes of EME crisis
  - Debt crisis in Latin America in 1980s
  - Mexico crisis in 1994/1995 => 'Tequila' crisis
  - Bulgarian crisis in 1996-1997

  - Turkish crisis in 2000-2001
  - EME crises in 2008-2010(Hungary, Latvia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, Pakistan)
  - Belarussian crisis in 2011

> Overcoming financial crises
  - Macroeconomic stabilization
