# [Week 5. Emerging markets and their role in global economy](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#economics-of-transition-and-emerging-markets)
## ***1. Emerging market crisis***
> Definitions
  - Financial Crisis: A sudden decline in confidence in relation to the government/central bank and banking sector ability to respect its liabilities(on the committed terms)
    - Banking crisis: actual or potential bank runs or failures that induce banks to suspend the internal convertibility of their liabilities
    - Public debt crisis: situation in which a government cannot service its foreign and/or domestic obligations
    - Balance of payment crisis => Currency crisis
      - BOM crisis: a structural misbalance between a deficit on the current account (absorption) and capital and financial accounts (sources of financing) that, after exhausting international reserves, leads to a currency crisis
      - Currency crisis: a sudden decline in confidence in a given currency

> ![EME currency crises_reserve losses and nominal depreciation of currency](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147915512-2afdf2c4-3183-44ab-b178-87e0eec6ea9c.PNG)

> Twin or triple crises
  - Banking crisis => public debt crisis
  - Banking crisis => currency crisis
  - Public debt crisis => banking crisis
  - Public debt crisis => currency crisis
  - Currency crisis => banking crisis
  - Currency crisis => public debt crisis

> Causes of banking crises
  - Credit boom or imprudent lending => large share of non-performing assets
  - Currency mismatches
  - Large potfolio of government securities
  - Confidence crisis
  - Sudden outflow of capital

> Cause of public debt crises
  - Imprudent fiscal polices
  - But it is difficult to estimate the exact thresholds of default risks
  ![GG gross debt-to-GDP ratio during the public debt crises](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147915975-2a377c6b-3431-4aa0-b13c-1ba4c9049a12.png)

> Factors detemining default risk
  - debt level
  - debt dynamics; if it grows rapidly it will create an additional risk factor;
  - outstanding debt maturity; if it is short it can cause problems with debt rollover;
  - availability of liquid financial assets, i.e., the difference between gross and net debt;
  - the share of non-residents among creditors; their high share may increase risk of their sudden exit from government bond market exit in the case of global or regional crisis;
  - the share of short-term investors among creditors (which also increase the risk of their sudden outflow the case of adverse shock);
  - the share of the debt liabilities denominated in foreign currency (important in case of currency depreciation)
  - the presence of the contingent liabilities, expecially in the banking and financial systems;
  - country's financial reputation (past episodes of defaults, high inflation and hyperinflation, banking crises, stability and reliability of the national currency, etc);
  - political stability and political ability of taking decisions necessary for fiscal consolidation, predictability of country's economic policy; 
  - tax potential of the country;
  - availability of non-tax sources of revenue, including rent revenue related to natural resources;
  - level of financial market development and its liquidity;
  - external demand for country's sovereign debt and other financial instruments and the international role of national currency;
  - situation on international financial markets; changes in global liquidity, changes in investors' mood, their response to unexpected shocks

> Causes of currency crises
  - First-generation model (Krugman, Flood & Garber): inconsistency between the exchange-rate peg and expansionary macroeconomic policy (fiscal and monetary) + speculation
  - Second-generation model (Obstfeld): uncertainty in respect to government's economic priorities (multiple equilibria)
  - Third-generation model (McKinnon & Phil, Krugman): private over-borrowing creates implicit public liabilities (of central bank and government) leading monetary and fiscal expansion (+ multiple equilibria)

> Role of exogenous shocks
  - Domestic: e.g., political crisis
  - External: increase of international interest rates (early 1980s), changes in major exchange rates (1990s), trade and price shocks, conflicts
  - Crisis spillover: trade and financial links
  - Contagion effect (expectations, herd behavior)

> Episodes of EME crisis
  - Debt crisis in Latin America in 1980s
  - Mexico crisis in 1994/1995 => 'Tequila' crisis
  - Bulgarian crisis in 1996-1997
  - Asian crisis in 1997-1998
  - Russian and CIS crisis in 1998-1999
  - Brazilian crisis in 1999
  - Argentinian crisis in 2000-2002
  - Turkish crisis in 2000-2001
  - EME crises in 2008-2010(Hungary, Latvia, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine, Pakistan)
  - Belarussian crisis in 2011

> Overcoming financial crises
  - Macroeconomic stabilization
  - Financial sector rehabilitation
  - Enterprise restructuring
  - Regulatory and institutional reforms
  - The role of IMF/ World Bank programs

## ***2. Impact of global financial crisis on EMEs(1)***
> Recent economic history
  - 2003-2007 global boom
  - 2007-2008 US "subprime" mortgage crisis
  - 2008-2009 global financial crisis after Lehman Brothers bankruptcy
  - 2010-2014 sovereign debt crisis in Europe, US and Japan and banking crisis in Europe
  - 2014-? emerging-market crisis?

> Characteristic of the crisis
  - Truly global financial crisis caused by bursting serveral bubbles
  - Started at core and is moving towards periphery (opposite to 1997-1998 emerging market crisis and similarly to the Great Depression and 1972 US dollar crisis)
  - Preceded by overheating of the world economy

> Several bubbles
  - Consumtion bubble in Us => Export bubble in emerging-market economies
  - Liquidity bubble (large stock of NFA)
  - Credit bubble
  - Housing bubble in US and other countries
  - Stock market bubble
  - Commodity bubble

> Factors reponsible for building bubbles
  - Highly accommodative monetary policy of the US Fed and other major central banks(fear of recession and deflation in US in early 2000s)
  - Mercantilist policies of many developing countries backed by IMF recommendations to build precautionary foreign-exchange reserves
  - Second-round phenomena (e.g. recycling of oil surpluses)

![Fed federal funds effective rate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147944949-8415eee0-8a99-4517-8064-16c2c96dd350.png)

> Delayed and limited inflationary consequences - why?
  - Positive supply side shocks (effects of market transition in many developing countries and post-communist world) and global trade liberalization - downward price pressure
  - Increasing demand for USD and EUR as global transaction currencies
  - Post-inflationary remonetization in emerging markets(backed by international reserves)
  - Absorption of excess liquidity by asset bubbles (asset prices are not covered by CPI)

> ![End-Of-year inflation in %](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147945410-c825c232-e018-422f-8a40-9aeb56e550a5.png)

> Other institutional, regulatory, and microeconomic factors responsible for the crisis
  - Lack of international coordination of macroeconomic (monetary) policies and financial supervision
  - Sectoral segmentation of financial supervision
  - Pro-cyclical prudential regulations (Basel 1 and 2)
  - Risk assenssment methodologies which were unable to follow financial innovations
  - Wrong incentives schemes (remuneration of management in financial institutions, fees for rating agencies, etc.)

> US anti-crisis policy - until LB bankruptcy
  - Attempt to avoid reccession
  - Aggressive cuts in Fed rates(from 5.25% to 2%)
  - Ad hoc supplying money market with additional liquidity (together with other major central banks)
  - Fiscal stimulus (mostly tax cuts and assistance to martgage borrowers)
  - Last minute bailing out of banks
  - Lack of long-term plan to rehabilitate financial sector 
  - Ignoring global effects of US economic policy decisions

> US anti-crisis policy - after LB bankruptcy
  - Attemp to avoid deep recession and deflation and rehabilitate financial sector
  - Quantitative monetary easing aimed to cushion collapse in financial intermediation
  - Aggressive fiscal stimulus packages (various addressees)
  - Last minute bailing out of banks
  - Closer international cooperation
 
## ***3. Impact of global financial crisis on EMEs(2)***
> How crisis has been transmitted to emerging markets?
  - Weaker global demand
  - Fall of commodity prices
  ![IMF Index of Primary Commodity Prices 2005=100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147995991-ce95e026-e3a6-49e2-953e-fc9a7c116bae.png)
  - Global liquidity squeeze
  - Troubles of financial institutions
  - Increasing risk aversion
  - Increased exchange rate volatility
  - Crowding out financial resources by fiscal stimulus
  ![Net private financial flows by major emerging-market regions 1990-2011](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147996179-e7ac4cef-64a6-47c8-bbfe-c9d3500d4ad1.png)
  - Decreasing demand for labor migrants

> EME's Vulnerabilities
  - High level of trade and financial openness
  - Deep recession in major destination markets
  - Sector characteristics(basic commodities, car industry, financial sector and housing/ real estate booms)
  - Currency and time mismatches in corporate and household sector
  - Lax fiscal policy in good times/ no fiscal reserves 
  - Poor business climate in some countries
  - Immature and fragile financial sector 
  - Limited credibility of domestic currencies (high level of actual dollarization / euroization in some countries)

## ***4. Impact of global financial crisis on CEE/CIS***
> Factors Behind CEE/CIS Booms Before 2008
  - Global economic boom (including commodity boom) fuelled by expansive US monetary policy and lax financial regulations
  - Post-transition growth recovery
  - EU accession (part of the region)

> ![Emerging Europe_real GDP annual change in % 2001-2010](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/148009486-ae35e98f-ef5e-4959-acd4-01db906ba2f8.PNG)

> Regions's vulnerabilities
  - Exceptionally low risk premia
  - Rapid capital inflows and credit boom (victims of its own success) => limited appetite for prudent polices
  - High trade dependence on the EU

> ![Net private capital flows and current account balance in CEE countries 1990-2011 in USD billion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/148009744-9ac04b8c-6ef4-4be2-898a-038efe04defa.png)

> Country-specific vulnerabilities
  - dependence on commodity prices (FSU)
  - dependence on privileged trade relation *BY)
  - maturity and currency mismatches (including borrowers)
  - tax incentives for mortgage borrowing (Baltics)
  - weak financial supervision
  - fiscal imbalances (especially if structurally adjusted)
  - unfinished transition agenda (largely FSU)

> IMF programs in 2008-2011
  - Standby arrangements: Hungary, Ukraine, Serbia, Latvia, Belarus, Romania, Moldova, Bosnia and Herzegovina (+ Iceland)
  - FCL: Poland
  - PCL: Macedonia

> The Vienna Initiative
  - Attempt to arrest regional contagion through banking channel
  - Private Sector Involvement(PSI) - to avoid using IFIs resources for full bail out of private creditors (lessons from emerging-market crises in 1980s and 1990s)
  - Largely successful
  - Ownership structure of CEE banks helped
