### [Week 1. Centrally planned economy its origins, evolution and collapse](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#list)
***1. Origins of Centrally Planned Economy and its major characteristic***
> Theoretical/idelogical foundations of a centrally planned economy(CPE)
  - Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenini's visions of a society without exploitation(associated with market forces and private ownership of means of production)
  - Because of the idelogical/political context, frequently called as communist/socialist/command economy
  
> Basic characteristics according to a communist/socialist doctrine
  - Rejecting private ownership of means of production => state or collective ownership(with minor exceptions)
  - Rejecting market coordination => central planning
  - Lenin : National economy as the single factory, vertically managed
  - Some other proposals never implemented(because of their utopian character)
    - individual consumtion according to 'needs'
    - Non-monetary economy
    
> Historical context of its implementation
  - Post-revolutionary Russia in the conditions of civil war and international isolation
  - Failure of the dream of worldwide revolution => necessity to 'build socialism in the single isolated country'
  - Russia's unfinished industrialization(mythology of the leading role of industrial working class)
  - Military needs
  
> Stages of implementation
  - The first attepmt('war communism' of 1918-1921) ; failed(famine, massive resistance of peasants)
  - Followed by the New Economic Policy(NEP)
  - The second attempt:Stalinist industrialization and collectivization ; completed at very high economic, social and human costs.
  - Model exported to Central and Eastern Europe and part of Asia after WW2
  
> CPE in its Stalinist version
  - The dominant role of central plan: production targets, allocation of inputs(including labor), investment decisions, secondary role of prices, financial flows and budget constraints
  - Administrative determination of prices and wages
  - State monopoly of foreign trade, lack of currency convertibility, multiple exchange rates, isolation from world markets, autarky
  - Forced industrialization(heavy and military industry) at the cost of other sectors
  
> Stalinist model: political and human dimension
  - Political totalitarianism(hegemony of communist party, restriction on political and civic freedoms, political terror)
  - The excessive power of the army, security agencies and police
  - Massive use of forced labor('Gulag' system)
  - Famine caused by collapse of private agriculture
  - Debatable economic results of the Soviet economy
  
> Effects of CPE model
  - Perverse microeconomic incentives connected with planning bargain: demand for lower production targets and higher input allocation; 'soft' budget constraints(Janos Kornai)
  - Price distortions and market shortages, rationing of consumer goods and productions inputs(shortage economy as of Janos Kornai)
  - Autarky, import-substitution industrialization, lack of international competitiveness, structural distortions
  - Political nominations for managerial positions

***2. Attempts to reform CPE***
> Early controversy over the efficiency of 'Socialist' model
  - Boris Brutskus and Ludwig Von Mises questioned efficiency of CPE in early 1920s, followed by Friedrich A. Hayek in 1930s and 1940s
  - Oskar Lange(1937) definded rationale of 'socialist' economy but not its actual form(Stalinist model) but the proposed sort of decentralized model - polemics with Von Mises('Socialist calculation debate')
  
> How to reform socialist economy? (1)
  - Idea: **relationalization of central planning** and its instruments using mathematical models of optimal planning and shadow prices(Oskar Lange, Leonid Kantorovich, Victor Novozhilov)
  - Problems: it disregarded information barriers(plan bargaining) and politicization of government price decisions
  
> How to reform socialist economy? (2)
  - Idea: **democoratization of central planning**(Woldzimierz Brus)
  - Problems: it contradicted political nature of both communist totalitarianism and democracy(democracy cannot exist without market and private property)
  
> How to reform socialist economy? (3)
  - Idea: **market socialism**, i.e., market mechanism without private ownership(Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Oskar Lange, Fred M. Taylor, Jaroslav Vanek, Branko Horvath, Wlodzimierz Brus)
  - Problems: Who is the economic subject/entrepreneur?
  
> Examples of complex reforms
  - Yugoslavia(early 1950s, 1965, 1972)
  - Hungary(1964, continuation in 1980s)
  - Czechoslovakia(1964-1969)?
  - Poland(1982)?
  
> Examples of partial reforms
  - Poland(1957-1959, 1972-1974)
  - Bulgaria(mid 1960s)
  - USSR(1964, period of perestroika)
  
> Problems of market socialism
  - How to protect economic autonomy of 'socialist' enterprise? The role of employee self-management
  - Goal function of a 'socialist' enterprise: profit or income/value added per 1 employee? Consequences for allocation of labor and capital
  - Macroeconomic disequilibrium originating from administrative price formation and weak macroeconomic policies
  - Imperfect property rights => negative impact on investment decisions, economic responsibility, soft budget constraints(Kornai) and market exit
  - Limits to private sector and foreign capital => weak market competition and innovations, only limited opening of an ecomony to external world(trade and labor flows but not capital)
  
> Lessons of 'socialist' reforms
  - Partial and slow reforms do not work: problem of 'critical mass' of reforms
  - Some political reforms needed for success of economic reforms(conflict between political monopoly of communist party and enterprise autonomy)
  - Key role of price liberalization, external openness and macroeconomic equilibrium at the early stage of reform.
  - The key role of rapid and mass privatization. Nevertherless, remnants of 'market socialism'(autonomous state enterprise) will continue exist in the transition period
  - Employees ownership can work only temporarily as the transition stage to unrestricted private ownership
  - Most of theoretical models of 'socialist reforms' proved impractical during market(post-communist) transition

***3. Collapse of the CPE***
> Changes in CPE after Stalin death
  - Less repressions
  - Greater focus on consumtion and social protection
  - Agriculture: from resource drain to subsidization
  - Pragmatic compromises(small land plots in Soviet Union, de-collectivization in Poland)

> ![Soviet economy - declining productivity rate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147810803-d8dbac63-40a8-441d-ae9c-71c69bf79c35.PNG)

> Economic deterioration in the USSR and other CPEs in 1980s
  - Limits of 'extensive' growth
  - Decline in oil prices since 1985(USSR)
  - High costs of arm race
  - Political weakening of communist regimes
    - Social concessions(to retain legitimacy)
    - Loosing control over managers
    - Partial and chaotic economic reforms
    
> ![Crude oil prices_Arabian light-Dubai_USD-bbl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147811179-890c586e-b78a-412f-b687-3e341cf33bd9.PNG)

> Effects of Chaotic reforms
  - Price arbitrage(income stripping) => building oligarchic fortunes
  - 'Nomenclature' privatization(assets stripping)
  - Collapse of planning discipline and coordination => systemic vacuum and unmanageability
  - Collapse of fiscal and monetary discipline => balance-of-payment crisis

> Sources of Macroeconomic Disequilibrium
  - Price control => market shortages => forced savings => monetary overhang(hidden [hyper] inflation)
  - Price control => subsidies to basic goods => budget deficit => money printing
  - Decrease of oil prices(former USSR)
  - Social populism of later communism
  - Long public debate about price liberalization

***4. Transition agenda***
> Transition in CEE/FSU
  - Macroeconomic stabilization
  - Domestic and external liberalization
  - Privatization and enterprise restructuring
  - Institutional and legal reform
  - Building a market-based social safety net
  - Political reform

> Macroeconomic stabilization
  - Fiscal adjustment (reducing subsidies [price liberalization] and government investment spending, market-based tax reform, creating room for SSN)
  - Stopping quasi-fiscal activities of central bank
  - Limiting credit expansion, active role of central bank, central bank independence, market-based monetary policy instruments
  - Temporary wage control in some countries

> Liberalization
  - Price deregulation, removing subsidies
  - Unification of exchange rate, current account convertibility, then capital account convertibility
  - Free private entrepreneurship, business deregulation
  - Trade liberalization(unilateral then followed by AA with the EU and EU/WTO accession)
  - Dismantling monobank, opening door for private and foreign banks, abolishing interest rate control

> Privatization and enterprise restructuring
  - Limited results of enterprise restructuring without privatization
  - Corporatization works only as the intermediate stage to privatization
  - The role of hard budget constraints and competition
  - Experience with various privatization schemes (IPOI, sales to strategic investor, voucher privatization, employee/management buy-out, debt-equity swap, joint-ventures)

> Institutional and legal reform
  - Building of various kind of market-support institutions and adopting market-oriented legislation
  - Crucial role of independent, professionally competent and uncorrupted judiciary as well as civil service
  - Helpful role of EU AA and EU accession(second-generation reforms)

> Social safety net
  - Moving from subsidies, benefits in-kind, labor safety and enterprise-based SSN to targeted SSN
  - Better targeting (political and institutional constraints)
  - Unemployment benefits and ALMP
  - Building a multi-pillar pension system
  - Demographic challenges (pension system & health care)
  - Mixed results of SSN ("premature post-communist welfare state")

***5. Challenges of stabilization and disinflation***
> Slow pace of disinflation
  - Legacy of the late communist/ early transition period(inertia)
  - Lax monetary policy (often dependent on political decisions)
  - Fiscal imbalances

> ![End-of-year inflation in transition economies 1991-2001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147812275-d70c8303-7abf-427b-b5e4-8ea1b21499a2.PNG)

> Hytperinflation episodes
  - Yugoslavia(310,000,000% monthly in January 1994)
  - Georgia(50,654% 12-months inflation in September 1994)
  - Armenia(29,600.9% 12-months inflation in May 1994)
  - Ukraine(10,155% 12-months inflation in December 1993)

![Cumulative inflation 1996-2001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147812421-28e74d64-d70c-4448-8f2f-55f0ade1fd0f.PNG)

> Stabilization strategies
  - Orthodox
    - Money based
    - Exchange-rate based
The crucial role of exchange rate stability(de facto) in bringing inflation down => the case of Balkan, Baltic and Caucasus countries

> Countries with Crawling peg / crawling band regimes / targeting real exchange rate
  - Poland (1991-2000)
  - Hungary(199502991)
  - Russia(1995-1998 and 2001-2002)
  - Slovenia

> What are the problems with the crawling peg/band regimes?
  - Building up strong inflationary inertia
  - Political resistance to slow down rate of crawl (export promotion target gets de facto priority)
  - Inability to target real exchange rate in the world of free capital mobility

> Monetary financing of a fiscal deficit

Fiscal deficit => Growth in monetary base => Growth in money supply => Inflation

> Domestic non-monetary financing

Fiscal deficit => Growing public debt under conditions of limited monetization and underdevelopment of financial market => Increasing yields of Treasury bills => Increasing interest payments => Further increase of fiscal deficit; expectation of default => Difficulties with rolling over Treasury bills => Return to monetary financing of fiscal deficit => Growth in monetary base => Growth in money supply => Inflation
  
> External private financing

Fiscal deficit => Increase in short term external debt in relation to GDP, export, foreign exchange reserves, budget revenue => Decreasing country credibility => Capital outflow => Difficulties with rolling over public debt + Decreasing foreign exchange reserves => Return to monetary financing of a fiscal deficit + change in composition of a moentary base => Speculative attack => Devaluation => Inflation

> Examples of disinflation trend reversal

![Examples of disinflation trend reversal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147813198-975a381e-623a-4220-8967-1e791c2b6da7.PNG)

***6. Privatization***
> Starting point of transition
  - Close to monopoly of state and cooperative/collective ownership in Czechoslovakia, USSR, Romania, Bulgaria
  - Some limited enclaves of private ownership in Poland(>20%), Yugoslavia, Hungary, GDR
  - Perestroika in the USSR: cooperatives, private leasing
  - Limited participation of foreign firms allowed only in Hungary, Yugoslavia and Poland

> Rebuilding private ownership
  - Creation of new domestic private firms
  - Green-filed FDI
  - Restitution of old private property rights
  - Privatization of housing
  - Privatization of land(political barriers in may CIS countries)
  - Privatization of state owned firms

> New private firms
  - Elimination of regulatory barriers
  - Tax incentives
  - Access to credit
  - Small-scale privatization

> Re-privatization / restitution
  - All CEE and Baltic except Polland(where only limited and delayed)
  - Physical restitution - mainly housing, land and small-scale production assets
  - Compensation in other cases
  - Several legal, political, technical and financial obstacles

> Large-scale privatization
  - Initial private offering
  - Selling to strategic investor (domestic or foreign)
  - Joint ventures with foreign firms
  - Employee and management buy-out(leveraged)
  - Voucher/coupon privatization, including voucher/coupon funds
  - Debt-to-equity swap
  - 'Liquidation' privatization

> Privatization dilemmas
  - Lack of stock exchange and few strategic investors in early stages of transition
  - Employee and voucher privatization slowed enterprise restructuring
  - Importance of hard budget constraints and macroeconomic stability
  - Political compromises and goals(building support for reform, 'peoples' capitalism, etc.)
  - Any privatization was better than no privatization

> Privatization outcomes
  - More than 50% of GDP contributed by a private sector in all countries but Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus
  - Several pockets of state ownership remains(maily infrastructure and industries considered as 'strategic')
  - Renationalization drift in Russia

### [Week 2. Post-communist transition and its outcomes](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#list)
***1. Political economy of transition and controversies over transition strategy***
> From the beginning of transition controversy over its speed and strategy
  - Fast vs. gradual transition
  - Called offten as 'shock' therapy or 'big bang' vs. gradualism
  - Emotional content and arguments

> Arguments in favor of fast transition
  - Expectation/ credibility when policymakers want to radically change the behavio of economic agents(both macro and micro)
  - Old institutions can damage new policies and danger of a systemic vacuum
  - Political economy of the reform process

> Political economy
  - Avoiding creation of intermediate winners (becoming stuck in the intermediate stage/ solutions)
  - Effective using of window of political opportunity (limited in time) => 'period of extraordinary politics' after the fall of communism (Balcerowicz)

> ![political and economic dynamics of the transition process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147852026-c1256eef-a489-4981-83af-d00aaca416ec.PNG)

> Arguments in favor of gradual transition
  - Minimizing social pain(but making it longer)
  - Giving time people and enterprises to adapt
  - Institution changes take time
 
> ![What can be done gradually](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147852067-26bf44bc-9185-4d6a-9145-d5ebc5bbc78c.PNG)

***2. Results of transition(the first decade)***
> Problems with statistical comparison
  - Lopw utility and low quality of final output/ limited consumption choice(structural distortions)
  - Prices(and exchange rates) not reflecting relative scarcity of goods and market equilibrium
  - High inflation/hyperinflation
  - Over-reporting(pripiska) versus underreporting during transition
  - Transition from NMP to GDP
   
> ![index of real GDP](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147852139-73229a83-8886-4841-acc9-09c402a5b595.png)

> Initial output decline
  - Consequence of inherited structural distortions
  - Result of policy mistakes (slow and inconsequent transition)

> Output recovery
  - Result of the first reform package
  - First stage(3-5 years) relativly easy - mainly reallocation of existing resources and capacities
  - Role of external factors
    - Global boom
    - Commodity boom(CIS)
    - Integration with the EU(CEE)

> ![Structural Reform Index for CEE and CIS countries 2000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147852238-82cba225-7c1c-4259-8e39-5ad13f548db5.PNG)

> Three basic factors of success
  - Pace of reforms (the role of time constraints, political economy of transition, comptetition between countries)
  - Comprehensiveness, consistency and consequence
  - Proper sequencing

> Other determinants of success
  - Starting conditions(economic and political)
  - Date of starting reforms
  - Geographic location
  - Domestic and external political and military conflicts

***.3 Market and democracy***
> Historical "stylized" facts
  - Examples of market economy without democracy while no democracies without market and private property;
  - Experience of early capitalism: no or limited democoracy
  - Examples of market-friendly authoritarianism(e.g. South-East Asia)
  - Examples of anti-market and populist dictatorships(Africa, Latin America)
  
> ![interrelation between economic and political freedom in the world](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147860739-60ef58e6-0585-417f-8f1e-cacdfe1f24c6.png)

> How market can help democracy?
  - It makes citizens independent economically from government (which is not the single owner and employer)
  - It limits power of government bureaucracy
  - It helps in country's external openness
  - It creates demand for rule of law
  - It helps to develop civil society institutions, a broad middle class, and cluture of cooperation based on self-interest, which reinforces democracy
  - It helps in economic development which, in turn, creates demand for political freedom and democracy(Barro, Lipset, Przeworshi & Limongi, Fukuyama)

> ![GPD 2005](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147860791-a7e6ce0f-91c5-48d4-aa98-516f6e41c545.PNG)

> How democracy helps market system)
  - It builds a system checks and balances(parlimentary and judicial control of executive)
  - It increases transparency of government actions, constrains opportunity for rent-seeking and capturing the state institutions and gives chance for long-term guarantee and stbility of property rights
  - Democratic rotation of political elites
  - Civil liberties support economic freedom
  - Democratic legitimacy of government helps in taking unpopular but badly needed economic decisions

***4. Interrelations between economic and political transition***
> The challenge of double transition
  - Simultaneously economic transition from plan to market and political transition from communist totalitarianism to democracy
  - Economic transition could start because previous political system collapsed

> Determinants of political transition
  - Initial change of political elite (who captured the reform process)
  - Speed of democratic reforms (avoiding intermediate trap)
  - External leverage (OSCE, Council of Europe, Nato and EU membership)
  - Domestic and regional conflicts
  - Choice of political regime and institutions

> Building the political institutions
  - Parliamentary versus presidential republic
  - Election system
  - The role of political parties
  - The role of free media and civil society institutions
  - Independent judiciary

> Why the authoritarian regimes hampered market reforms in post-communnist countries)
  - Social base of dictatorship: former communists, army, security service, old-style administration
  - Consolidation of old group of interests
  - Slower changes in economic and political elites
  - Less openness to the outside world

> Myth of 'enlightened' market-friendly authoritarianism in post-communist countries
  - Early transition: turbulences of young, immature democracies
  - Late transition: authoritarian drift in CIS
  - Transition in China and Vietnam
  - Chile(Pinochet)

> ![freedom house political and civil liberties index](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147861004-a804bc4f-091e-4a95-a891-248cc7f28c7f.PNG)

> Correlation between indexes of political and economic freedom in post-communist countries
![correlation between index of political and economic freedom in post-communist countries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147861027-e3067f7b-2a41-4d4a-b220-e4e3a8b6c756.png)

> Negative experience of authoritarianism
  - Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
  - Belarus after 1996
  - Slovakia 1994-1998
  - Russia after 2003
  - Ukraine 2010-2014
  - Hungary after 2010

> ineffective autocratic post-Soviet state
  - Excessive interference in business activity
  - Parasite behavior of government officials in relation to business(particularly of law enforcement agencies)
  - Widespread corruption
  - Militarization
  - Inability to provide basic public goods

***5. The role of external actors in shaping the transition process***
> External anchoring -  why is helpful?
  - Problems with domestic anchors
    - Ex ante and ex post political constraints of reform
    - Time inconsistency
    - Multiple equilibria (coordination failures)

  - External influence
    - Incentives
    - Guidance
    - Monitoring

> Conditions of effective external anchoring
  - Carrots(stick = no carrot) must be realistic, understandable and widely desirable
  - Commitment on part of club memebers must be credible
  - Conditionality must be very demanding but fair
  - Acutual implementation can take decades, what matters is the process itself

> Key providers of external anchoring
  - EU NMS and candidates => EU and NATO membership
  - CIS => Bretton Woods institutions, Council of Europe, OSCE, recently EU Association and FTAs

> Magnetism of EU intergration
  - Political ('club') membership
  - Geopolitics and security
  - Four basic freedoms(goods, services, capital, labor)
  - Prospects of prosperity
  - Structural funds

> Why is the EU Conditionality more effective
  - Incentives
    EU (and NATO) accession criteria
    - strong carrot/stick mechanism(EU membership/exclusion)
    - important to public at large
    IMF program conditionality
    - weak carrot/stick mechanism(loan disbursement/ non-disbursement)
    - irrelevant to broader public
  - Conditions
    EU (and NATO) accession criteria
    - broadly defined(democracy, free market, European law)
    - strong public understanding and support of the ultimate goal
    IMF program conditionality
    - narrowly defined(abstract macroeconomic, technical or specific structural benchmarks)
    - scant public understanding and support, opposing interest groups
  - Monitoring
    EU (and NATO) accession criteria
    - high credibility of enforcment(strong interest of incumbents to keep non-performers outside EU)
    - full compliance required: 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed'(prevents paper reforms and policy reversals)
    - long term horizon ('it will take as much time as needed')
    IMF program conditionality
    - low credibility of enforcement(IMF/WB interested in load disbursements)
    - frequent non-implementation - waivers, new programs following program failures(allows for paper reforms and policy reversals)
    - short term horizon(short-term, e.g. quarterly point deadlines)

> ![reform progress index of institutional quality](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147861310-b92890cb-ebc5-48f1-bec0-049da119f200.png)

> Direction of causality?
  - Membership perspective anchors reforms or progress in reforms makes membership possible, for fundamental factors(geography, culture etc.) drive both?
  - Virtuous circle very likely: better accession prospects => more reforms => better prospects reinforced by trade and FDI flows

> Some confirmation of direction of causality
  - Enlargement driven by exogenous political decisions(for example, the 'Helsinki" group in 1999, the stability pact for South and Eastern Europe, 1999)
  - Slovakia U-turned on her policies, clearly due to risk of being excluded from EU and NATI membership
  - But all reformist governments tend to declare EU membership as strategic goal (examples of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine)

### [Week 3. The role of external actors in post-communist transition and economic reforms in Aisa](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#list)
***1. Transition countries and the EU***
> EU accession of less developed countries
  - Mediterranean Enlargement of 1980s(Greece, Portugal and Spain)
  - Eastern Enlargement 2004, 2007, 2013(Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Rep., Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia)

> Eu Candidates
  - Negotiating(Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia)
  - Waiting for Negotiation (Macedonia)
  - Potential(Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Kosovo)

> ![Timetable of EU intergration process of post-communist countries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147862300-2c6dc62d-5eaa-440e-9119-e18d652f9ebe.PNG)

> Stages of accession process (1)
  - Stabilization and association Agreement
  - Membership application
  - Obtaining the EU Candidate status
  - Opening membership negotiations(35 chapters)
  - Concluding memebership negotiation

> Copenhagen Criteria for EU Accession
  - Stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and repect for and protection of minorities
  - The existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union
  - Ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union

> Stages of accession process (2)
  - Signing an accession treaty
  - Ratification of accession treaty and entering the EU
  - Post-accession monitoring(Cooperation and Verification Mechanism)
  - Post-accession transitory periods, Schengen accession, EMU accession

> More difficult conditions of next EU enlargements
  - Post-enlargement fatigure(in OMS and NMS)
  - Economic crisis in the EU
  - Most candidates represent low GDP per capita level
  - Post-conflict situation in Western Balkans
  - No more 'wholesales' enlargements(like 2004 one)
  - Weaker carrot & stronger stick: less chances for waivers
  - Danger of anti-accession backlash (example of Turkey)

> EU Eastern Partnetship Offer
  - Association Agreement
  - Deep and Comprehensive FTA
  - Visa facilitation => Visa liberalization
  - Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs
  - Central Asia excluded

***2. Transition countries in early 2010s***
> End of transition?(1)
  - Basic transition agenda completed in early 2000s: the largest, fastest and most complex reform episode in contemporary economic history (ca. 15 years)?
  - In most former communist countries market mechanism coordinates most of productions and investment decisions
  - Private sector contributes between 60%and 80% of GDP(EBRD, 2010). Eceptions: Turkmenistan(25%), Belarus(30%), Uzbekistan(45% of private sector in GDP) + North Korea and Cuba

> End of transition?(2)
  - Openness to international trade
  - Various level of market distortions and various quality of governance
  - Decade of 2000s: rapid economic growth, low or morderate inflation, remonetization, high international reserves, improvement of fiscal balances; but part of these achievements reversed ni 2008-2010

> Relative weight
  - Russia: 3% of world GDP in 2010; comparing to China(13.6%)m India(5.5%), Brazil(2.9%)
  - EU NMS contributed to 5.4% of GDP of EU27 in 2004 and to 7.4% in 2010; Poland: 2.9% of EU27 GPD in 2010, Czech Republic (1.2%), Romania(1%)

> Challenges and problems ahead
  - Post-crisis environment: slower and more fragile growth, higher debts, volatile commodity markets, inflation pressures
  - How to improve business climate and governance (CIS and Western Balkans)?
  - How to avoid marginalization in global economy(CIS, Central Asia)
  - Unsustainable welfare state(NMS, Western Balkans, Western CIS)

***3. Specifics of Chinese transition***
> Wrong comparisions
  - In 1990s numerous suggestions that CEE/FSU could follow Chinese experience to avoid transition-related output decline(part of the transition-controversy debate) - eg. Rawski or Stiglitz
  - Apart from wrong interpretation of facts(e.g. Russian 'shock therapy' vs Chinese 'gradualism'), disregard for differences in starting conditions.

> Three differences in starting conditions
  - Level of economic development and industrialization
  - Social policy and social services
  - Political environment

> Level of economic development
  - At the starting point of market transition(1989-1991) CEE/FSU had GDP PPP per capita level 20-50 times higher than China in 1980
  ![Original GNI per capita, PPP_current international $](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147871838-8503626b-e287-40e7-b0e7-a832e993b19f.png)

> Structural characteristics
  - State owned industry was non-competitive in both cases but China was under-industrialized and CEE/FSU over-industrialized, with high share of military industry
  - Labor surplus in China vs. Labor shortage in CEE/FUS
  - Ineffective and 'industrialized' agriculture in CEE/FSU: Level of structural distortions in CEE/FSU much higher than in China(e.g. higher energy intensity)

> Share of military expenditure in GDP in %(1989)
  - China 2.7
  - Hungary 3.1
  - Poland 1.9
  - Romania 4.8
  - Russia 17.5

> Differences on a social front
  - In China only public sector employees covered by publicly financed pension system and other social policy instruments(ca. 20% of pupulation)
  - In CEE/FSU excessive burden of social programs(legitimization attempt of late communist regimes)- share in GDP close to that in Western Europe
  - Higher level of social services(health, education, etc) provision in CEE/FSU comparing to China

> Diffrences on political front
  - At the late stage of communism governments in CEE/FSU unable to use coercive power on massive scale => inability to continue selectively elements of command system (opposite situation in China)
  - Finally spontaneous collapse of the centrally planned economy in CEE/FSU
  - Demand for democratization in CEE/ part of FSU

> Consequences for transition strategies
  - CEE/FSU had to de-industrialize in order to create room for market-oriented restructuring. China had free resources (surplus labor in agriculture) - analogy with NEP in USSR in 1920s
  - Easy way of privatizing agriculture in China and starting new private/ quasi-private sector outside agriculture
  - Necessity to reduce social spending in CEE/FSU in order to secure macroeconomic stability
  - Building market economy under authoritarian regime was not the option for most CEE/FSU countries in late 1980s/early 1990s wile it was the option for China
  - 'Gradualism' less promising in CEE/FSU because of government inability of 'fine tuning' (sometimes even problems with providing basic public goods); in addition, disappointing  experience with 'market socialism' reforms before

***4. Main stages of Chinese transition***
> Economic history before Mao
  - Until early 19th century the largest world economy (>30% of world GDP) with GDP per capita level at world's average even if Chinese economy stagnated since 16th century
  - Most of 19th and 20th centuries - stagnation or decline caused by political developments(short period of fster growth in 1920s and early 1930s)

> Economic model of Mao Zedong
  - Soviet-type central planning system
  - Collectivization of agriculture - People's communes => famine
  - Forceful industrialization of Stalinist type - 'The Great Leap Forward'(1958-1959) => collapse of the economy
  - Cultural revolution of 1966-1969(1971)

> Stages of Chinese reforms
  - 1978-1984(Deng Xiaoping): de-collectivization of agriculture (the 'household responsibility system'), dual price system in urban industry, special economic zones(FDI), private enterprises allowed
  - 1984-1993(Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang): decentralization (=> regional experiments), township and village enterprises, reopening Shanghai Stock Exchange; but also suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989
  - 1993-2005(Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji): unifying exchange rate and current account convertibility, trade liberalization, joining the WTO, Large-scale privatization, financial sector reform
  - Since 2005(Hu Jintao): reform stagnation, more subsidies, lax monetary policy leading to credit and real-estate bubbble, public investment boom, increasing international controversies over underappreciated exchage rate

> Common features of Chinese policies
  - Export-led growth strategy based on low-cost labor, underappreciated exchage rate and FDI
  - Strong focus on macroeconomic equilibria
  - Limited role of social programs

> Controversy around Chinese 'gradualism'
  - The initial reform(de-collectivization) was radical
  - The subsequent gradualism resulted from political resistance within communist party apparatus rather then a priori choice
  - China has room for gradualist reforms unlike CEE/CIS
  - Costs of gradualism(income inequality and regional disparities)

> Result of Chinese reforms
  - Very high growth rate - ca. 10% annually, on average
  - Second largest economy inthe world(after the US) but less than 12% of US GDP per capita at current prices and 17.5% in PPP terms
  - The largest world creditor
  - The largest world manufacturing exporter
  - More than 70% of GDP contributed by private or quasi-private sector
  - But property rights not fully transparent
  - Reduction of poverty
  - But increase in inequality(Gini coefficient > 0.45)
  - Relative macroeconomic stability(as for emerging markets standards)

> Challenges ahead
  - Elements of financial crisis
  - Forthcoming demographic crisis
  - Limits of 'extensive' growth and export-led growth
  - Ecological, social and urbanization barriers
  - Need for new reform round and change in growth strategy

***5. Economic transition in other Asian countries***
> Following Chinese experience
  - Vietnam since 1986(Doi Moi reforms)
  - Laos since 1986(The New Economic Mechanisms)
  - Cambodia since 1985
  - Myanmar(Burma) since 2011
  - The helpful role of ASEAN integration

> Political and economic reforms in Mongolia
  - Economically and politically closer to USSR than China
  - Communist regime and CPE until 1990
  - Soviet aid - up to 1/3 Mongolian GDP => huge debt(300-700% of GDP depending on exchange rate of transfer ruble)
  - Soviet-type industrialization => structural distortions
  - Successful political transition to multi-party democracy
  - Fast market reforms of early 1990s
  - Rapid growth based on commodity boom(copper, gold and other non-ferrous metals)

> Background of economic reforms in India
  - The largest democracy in the world based on the British legal system, federal state
  - But until 1991 economy policy was based on a sort of Socialist ideoloty(Fabian socialism) and import-subsititution strategy
  - Two unsuccessful attempts of reforms(1966-1967 and 1985-1987)
  - Growth(average 3.5%, per capita 1%) slower as compared to neighbors

> Economic system in India before 1991
  - Predominantly private economy but with large share of public ownership(industry, infrastructure, banks)
  - Currency inconvertibility
  - Strong trade protectionism
  - Internal overregulation('License Raj')
  - Role of indicative central planning
  - Large agriculture subsidies
  - Financial repression

> Triggers of economic reforms in India
  - Balance-of-payment crisis in 1991
  - IMF program
  - More generally:geopolitical competition with China and Pakistan
  - Government of Narasimaba Rao and Manmohan Singh

> Economic reform in India in 1991
  - Current account convertibility
  - Partial trade openness
  - Partial internal deregulation
  - Breaking up state monopolies
  - Reducing subsidies, fiscal adjustment
  - Privatization
  - Disinflation

> India's challenges
  - High growth(7-9%) but slower than China, especially in per capita terms
  - Remaining large pockets of poverty
  - High income inequality
  - Health and education challenges
  - Corruption
  - Remaining 'red' tape
  - Limits on FDI
  - Remaining trade protectionism(especially agriculture)
  - Macroeconomic fragilities(near currency crisis in 2013)
  - Reform stagnation after 2007
