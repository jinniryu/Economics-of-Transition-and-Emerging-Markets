### Week 1. Centrally planned economy its origins, evolution and collapse
***1. Origins of Centrally Planned Economy and its major characteristic***
> Theoretical/idelogical foundations of a centrally planned economy(CPE)
  - Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenini's visions of a society without exploitation(associated with market forces and private ownership of means of production)
  - Because of the idelogical/political context, frequently called as communist/socialist/command economy
> Basic characteristics according to a communist/socialist doctrine
  - Rejecting private ownership of means of production => state or collective ownership(with minor exceptions)
  - Rejecting market coordination => central planning
  - Lenin : National economy as the single factory, vertically managed
  - Some other proposals never implemented(because of their utopian character)
    - individual consumtion according to 'needs'
    - Non-monetary economy
> Historical context of its implementation
  - Post-revolutionary Russia in the conditions of civil war and international isolation
  - Failure of the dream of worldwide revolution => necessity to 'build socialism in the single isolated country'
  - Russia's unfinished industrialization(mythology of the leading role of industrial working class)
  - Military needs
> Stages of implementation
  - The first attepmt('war communism' of 1918-1921) ; failed(famine, massive resistance of peasants)
  - Followed by the New Economic Policy(NEP)
  - The second attempt:Stalinist industrialization and collectivization ; completed at very high economic, social and human costs.
  - Model exported to Central and Eastern Europe and part of Asia after WW2
> CPE in its Stalinist version
  - The dominant role of central plan: production targets, allocation of inputs(including labor), investment decisions, secondary role of prices, financial flows and budget constraints
  - Administrative determination of prices and wages
  - State monopoly of foreign trade, lack of currency convertibility, multiple exchange rates, isolation from world markets, autarky
  - Forced industrialization(heavy and military industry) at the cost of other sectors
> Stalinist model: political and human dimension
  - Political totalitarianism(hegemony of communist party, restriction on political and civic freedoms, political terror)
  - The excessive power of the army, security agencies and police
  - Massive use of forced labor('Gulag' system)
  - Famine caused by collapse of private agriculture
  - Debatable economic results of the Soviet economy
> Effects of CPE model
  - Perverse microeconomic incentives connected with planning bargain: demand for lower production targets and higher input allocation; 'soft' budget constraints(Janos Kornai)
  - Price distortions and market shortages, rationing of consumer goods and productions inputs(shortage economy as of Janos Kornai)
  - Autarky, import-substitution industrialization, lack of international competitiveness, structural distortions
  - Political nominations for managerial positions

***2. Attempts to reform CPE***
> Early controversy over the efficiency of 'Socialist' model
  - Boris Brutskus and Ludwig Von Mises questioned efficiency of CPE in early 1920s, followed by Friedrich A. Hayek in 1930s and 1940s
  - Oskar Lange(1937) definded rationale of 'socialist' economy but not its actual form(Stalinist model) but the proposed sort of decentralized model - polemics with Von Mises('Socialist calculation debate')
> How to reform socialist economy? (1)
  - Idea: **relationalization of central planning** and its instruments using mathematical models of optimal planning and shadow prices(Oskar Lange, Leonid Kantorovich, Victor Novozhilov)
  - Problems: it disregarded information barriers(plan bargaining) and politicization of government price decisions
> How to reform socialist economy? (2)
  - Idea: **democoratization of central planning**(Woldzimierz Brus)
  - Problems: it contradicted political nature of both communist totalitarianism and democracy(democracy cannot exist without market and private property)
> How to reform socialist economy? (3)
  - Idea: **market socialism**, i.e., market mechanism without private ownership(Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Oskar Lange, Fred M. Taylor, Jaroslav Vanek, Branko Horvath, Wlodzimierz Brus)
  - Problems: Who is the economic subject/entrepreneur?
> Examples of complex reforms
  - Yugoslavia(early 1950s, 1965, 1972)
  - Hungary(1964, continuation in 1980s)
  - Czechoslovakia(1964-1969)?
  - Poland(1982)?
> Examples of partial reforms
  - Poland(1957-1959, 1972-1974)
  - Bulgaria(mid 1960s)
  - USSR(1964, period of perestroika)
> Problems of market socialism
  - How to protect economic autonomy of 'socialist' enterprise? The role of employee self-management
  - Goal function of a 'socialist' enterprise: profit or income/value added per 1 employee? Consequences for allocation of labor and capital
  - Macroeconomic disequilibrium originating from administrative price formation and weak macroeconomic policies
  - Imperfect property rights => negative impact on investment decisions, economic responsibility, soft budget constraints(Kornai) and market exit
  - Limits to private sector and foreign capital => weak market competition and innovations, only limited opening of an ecomony to external world(trade and labor flows but not capital)
> Lessons of 'socialist' reforms
  - Partial and slow reforms do not work: problem of 'critical mass' of reforms
  - Some political reforms needed for success of economic reforms(conflict between political monopoly of communist party and enterprise autonomy)
  - Key role of price liberalization, external openness and macroeconomic equilibrium at the early stage of reform.
  - The key role of rapid and mass privatization. Nevertherless, remnants of 'market socialism'(autonomous state enterprise) will continue exist in the transition period
  - Employees ownership can work only temporarily as the transition stage to unrestricted private ownership
  - Most of theoretical models of 'socialist reforms' proved impractical during market(post-communist) transition

***3. Collapse of the CPE***
> Changes in CPE after Stalin death
  - Less repressions
  - Greater focus on consumtion and social protection
  - Agriculture: from resource drain to subsidization
  - Pragmatic compromises(small land plots in Soviet Union, de-collectivization in Poland)
