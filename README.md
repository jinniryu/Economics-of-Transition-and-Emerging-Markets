Week 1. Centrally planned economy its origins, evolution and collapse
1. Origins of Centrally Planned Economy and its major characteristic
- Theoretical/idelogical foundations of a centrally planned economy(CPE)
  - Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenini's visions of a society without exploitation(associated with market forces and private ownership of means of production)
  - Because of the idelogical/political context, frequently called as communist/socialist/command economy
- Basic characteristics according to a communist/socialist doctrine
  - Rejecting private ownership of means of production => state or collective ownership(with minor exceptions)
  - Rejecting market coordination => central planning
  - Lenin : National economy as the single factory, vertically managed
  - Some other proposals never implemented(because of their utopian character)
    - individual consumtion according to 'needs'
    - Non-monetary economy
