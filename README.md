### Week 1. Centrally planned economy its origins, evolution and collapse
1. Origins of Centrally Planned Economy and its major characteristic
'- Theoretical/idelogical foundations of a centrally planned economy(CPE)
  - Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenini's visions of a society without exploitation(associated with market forces and private ownership of means of production)
  - Because of the idelogical/political context, frequently called as communist/socialist/command economy'
'- Basic characteristics according to a communist/socialist doctrine
  - Rejecting private ownership of means of production => state or collective ownership(with minor exceptions)
  - Rejecting market coordination => central planning
  - Lenin : National economy as the single factory, vertically managed
  - Some other proposals never implemented(because of their utopian character)
    - individual consumtion according to 'needs'
    - Non-monetary economy'
'- Historical context of its implementation
  - Post-revolutionary Russia in the conditions of civil war and international isolation
  - Failure of the dream of worldwide revolution => necessity to 'build socialism in the single isolated country'
  - Russia's unfinished industrialization(mythology of the leading role of industrial working class)
  - Military needs'
'- Stages of implementation
  - The first attepmt('war communism' of 1918-1921) ; failed(famine, massive resistance of peasants)
  - Followed by the New Economic Policy(NEP)
  - The second attempt:Stalinist industrialization and collectivization ; completed at very high economic, social and human costs.
  - Model exported to Central and Eastern Europe and part of Asia after WW2'
- CPE in its Stalinist version
  - The dominant role of central plan: production targets, allocation of inputs(including labor), investment decisions, secondary role of prices, financial flows and budget constraints
  - Administrative determination of prices and wages
  - State monopoly of foreign trade, lack of currency convertibility, multiple exchange rates, isolation from world markets, autarky
  - Forced industrialization(heavy and military industry) at the cost of other sectors
- Stalinist model:political and human dimension
  - Political totalitarianism(hegemony of communist party, restriction on political and civic freedoms, political terror)
  - The excessive power of the army, security agencies and police
  - Massive use of forced labor(
