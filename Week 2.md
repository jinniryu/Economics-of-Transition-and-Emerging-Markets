# [Week 2. Post-communist transition and its outcomes](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#list)
## ***1. Political economy of transition and controversies over transition strategy***
> From the beginning of transition controversy over its speed and strategy
  - Fast vs. gradual transition
  - Called offten as 'shock' therapy or 'big bang' vs. gradualism
  - Emotional content and arguments

> Arguments in favor of fast transition
  - Expectation/ credibility when policymakers want to radically change the behavio of economic agents(both macro and micro)
  - Old institutions can damage new policies and danger of a systemic vacuum
  - Political economy of the reform process

> Political economy
  - Avoiding creation of intermediate winners (becoming stuck in the intermediate stage/ solutions)
  - Effective using of window of political opportunity (limited in time) => 'period of extraordinary politics' after the fall of communism (Balcerowicz)

> Arguments in favor of gradual transition
  - Minimizing social pain(but making it longer)
  - Giving time people and enterprises to adapt
  - Institution changes take time
 
> ![What can be done gradually](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147852067-26bf44bc-9185-4d6a-9145-d5ebc5bbc78c.PNG)

## ***2. Results of transition(the first decade)***
> Problems with statistical comparison
  - Lopw utility and low quality of final output/ limited consumption choice(structural distortions)
  - Prices(and exchange rates) not reflecting relative scarcity of goods and market equilibrium
  - High inflation/hyperinflation
  - Over-reporting(pripiska) versus underreporting during transition
  - Transition from NMP to GDP

> Initial output decline
  - Consequence of inherited structural distortions
  - Result of policy mistakes (slow and inconsequent transition)

> Output recovery
  - Result of the first reform package
  - First stage(3-5 years) relativly easy - mainly reallocation of existing resources and capacities
  - Role of external factors
    - Global boom
    - Commodity boom(CIS)
    - Integration with the EU(CEE)

> Three basic factors of success
  - Pace of reforms (the role of time constraints, political economy of transition, comptetition between countries)
  - Comprehensiveness, consistency and consequence
  - Proper sequencing

> Other determinants of success
  - Starting conditions(economic and political)
  - Date of starting reforms
  - Geographic location
  - Domestic and external political and military conflicts

## ***3. Market and democracy***
> Historical "stylized" facts
  - Examples of market economy without democracy while no democracies without market and private property;
  - Experience of early capitalism: no or limited democoracy
  - Examples of market-friendly authoritarianism(e.g. South-East Asia)
  - Examples of anti-market and populist dictatorships(Africa, Latin America)

> How market can help democracy?
  - It makes citizens independent economically from government (which is not the single owner and employer)
  - It limits power of government bureaucracy
  - It helps in country's external openness
  - It creates demand for rule of law
  - It helps to develop civil society institutions, a broad middle class, and cluture of cooperation based on self-interest, which reinforces democracy
  - It helps in economic development which, in turn, creates demand for political freedom and democracy(Barro, Lipset, Przeworshi & Limongi, Fukuyama)

> How democracy helps market system)
  - It builds a system checks and balances(parlimentary and judicial control of executive)
  - It increases transparency of government actions, constrains opportunity for rent-seeking and capturing the state institutions and gives chance for long-term guarantee and stbility of property rights
  - Democratic rotation of political elites
  - Civil liberties support economic freedom
  - Democratic legitimacy of government helps in taking unpopular but badly needed economic decisions

## ***4. Interrelations between economic and political transition***
> The challenge of double transition
  - Simultaneously economic transition from plan to market and political transition from communist totalitarianism to democracy
  - Economic transition could start because previous political system collapsed

> Determinants of political transition
  - Initial change of political elite (who captured the reform process)
  - Speed of democratic reforms (avoiding intermediate trap)
  - External leverage (OSCE, Council of Europe, Nato and EU membership)
  - Domestic and regional conflicts
  - Choice of political regime and institutions

> Building the political institutions
  - Parliamentary versus presidential republic
  - Election system
  - The role of political parties
  - The role of free media and civil society institutions
  - Independent judiciary

> Why the authoritarian regimes hampered market reforms in post-communnist countries)
  - Social base of dictatorship: former communists, army, security service, old-style administration
  - Consolidation of old group of interests
  - Slower changes in economic and political elites
  - Less openness to the outside world

> Myth of 'enlightened' market-friendly authoritarianism in post-communist countries
  - Early transition: turbulences of young, immature democracies
  - Late transition: authoritarian drift in CIS
  - Transition in China and Vietnam
  - Chile(Pinochet)

> Negative experience of authoritarianism
  - Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
  - Belarus after 1996
  - Slovakia 1994-1998
  - Russia after 2003
  - Ukraine 2010-2014
  - Hungary after 2010

> ineffective autocratic post-Soviet state
  - Excessive interference in business activity
  - Parasite behavior of government officials in relation to business(particularly of law enforcement agencies)
  - Widespread corruption
  - Militarization
  - Inability to provide basic public goods

## ***5. The role of external actors in shaping the transition process***
> External anchoring -  why is helpful?
  - Problems with domestic anchors
    - Ex ante and ex post political constraints of reform
    - Time inconsistency
    - Multiple equilibria (coordination failures)

  - External influence
    - Incentives
    - Guidance
    - Monitoring

> Conditions of effective external anchoring
  - Carrots(stick = no carrot) must be realistic, understandable and widely desirable
  - Commitment on part of club memebers must be credible
  - Conditionality must be very demanding but fair
  - Acutual implementation can take decades, what matters is the process itself

> Key providers of external anchoring
  - EU NMS and candidates => EU and NATO membership
  - CIS => Bretton Woods institutions, Council of Europe, OSCE, recently EU Association and FTAs

> Magnetism of EU intergration
  - Political ('club') membership
  - Geopolitics and security
  - Four basic freedoms(goods, services, capital, labor)
  - Prospects of prosperity
  - Structural funds

> Why is the EU Conditionality more effective
  - Incentives
    EU (and NATO) accession criteria
    - strong carrot/stick mechanism(EU membership/exclusion)
    - important to public at large
    IMF program conditionality
    - weak carrot/stick mechanism(loan disbursement/ non-disbursement)
    - irrelevant to broader public
  - Conditions
    EU (and NATO) accession criteria
    - broadly defined(democracy, free market, European law)
    - strong public understanding and support of the ultimate goal
    IMF program conditionality
    - narrowly defined(abstract macroeconomic, technical or specific structural benchmarks)
    - scant public understanding and support, opposing interest groups
  - Monitoring
    EU (and NATO) accession criteria
    - high credibility of enforcment(strong interest of incumbents to keep non-performers outside EU)
    - full compliance required: 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed'(prevents paper reforms and policy reversals)
    - long term horizon ('it will take as much time as needed')
    IMF program conditionality
    - low credibility of enforcement(IMF/WB interested in load disbursements)
    - frequent non-implementation - waivers, new programs following program failures(allows for paper reforms and policy reversals)
    - short term horizon(short-term, e.g. quarterly point deadlines)

> ![reform progress index of institutional quality](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147861310-b92890cb-ebc5-48f1-bec0-049da119f200.png)

> Direction of causality?
  - Membership perspective anchors reforms or progress in reforms makes membership possible, for fundamental factors(geography, culture etc.) drive both?
  - Virtuous circle very likely: better accession prospects => more reforms => better prospects reinforced by trade and FDI flows

> Some confirmation of direction of causality
  - Enlargement driven by exogenous political decisions(for example, the 'Helsinki" group in 1999, the stability pact for South and Eastern Europe, 1999)
  - Slovakia U-turned on her policies, clearly due to risk of being excluded from EU and NATI membership
  - But all reformist governments tend to declare EU membership as strategic goal (examples of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine)
