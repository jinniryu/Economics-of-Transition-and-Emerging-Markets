# [EMEs, globalization and international trade](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#economics-of-transition-and-emerging-markets)
## ***1. EMEs and unrestricted capital movement***
> Consequences of financial globalization
  - Capital mobility and balance-of-payment management
  - Capital mobility and monetary policy
  - What policy instruments remain in the hands of national governments (in both cases)

> BoP analysis: traditional assumptions
  - BoP and IIP: concepts based on residency
  - capital has its fixed residency (domicile)
  - individual country gross national investment must be ultimately financed out of this country gross national saving (even if inter-temporal balance-of-payments imbalances are accepted) - echo of the Feldstein-Horioka (1980) 'home country bias'

> BoP analysis: policy implications of traditional assumptions
  Net caital inflow leads to accumulation of country's external liabilities, which
  - cannot grow indefinitely,
  - must be repaid at some point.
  - higher they are, more vulnerable country's external position is

> BoP analysis: the alternative set of assumptions
  - unrestricted international capital mobility
  - major sources of capital do not have country of origin (may change their domicile)
  - private investors seek the highest rate of return disregarding country borders
  - some countries may offer higher rate of return than others for a long period

> Can countries influence the size and direction of capital flows?
  - Capital controls - unavailable for EU members, doubtful effectiveness in other cases
  - Monetary policy (no impact under hard peg, limited impact under flexible exchage rate)
  - Fiscal policy (macro): some impact
  - Fiscal incetives(micro): some impact(more in respect to structure of capital flows than volume)
  - Macro-prudential regulation: depending what does it mean in practice
  - Micro-prudential regulation: see fiscal incentives

> BoP analysis: consequences of modified assumptions
  - Country may become capital exporter or capital importer for a long period of time
  - The expected rate of return determines the direction of capital movement
  - In the case of capital outflow it also affects residents
  - But current account imbalances still matter as long as country has its own currency (exchane rate risk)

> Current account vs. Capital account(1)
  - Tranditional approach (in the world of restricted captial mobility): domestic factors of competitiveness + trade policy + exchange rate policy => trade and current account balance => capital flows
  - The reserve causality in the world of free capital mobility: net capital flows have exogenous character and current account balance adapts to changes in capital account (through changes in real exchange rates)

  ![LAC_capital vs  current account](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/148036874-2386058e-bde4-4129-89fc-c597169ffbdf.png)

> Current account vs. Capital account(1)
  - Policy consequences: national macroeconomic policy has limited control over current account balance and real exchane rate (even if it contrls nominal exchage rate)
  - Criteria of assessment of current account: who is doing well, who is vulnerable

> Capital mobility and monetary policy (national perspective)
  - Domestic money supply is largely exogenous as result of capital flows
  - Even under the free floating exchange rate and inflation targeting limited room of maneuver (interest rate decisions must take into account international financial market trends, limits of currency appreciation/depreciation)
  - Consequences of monetary polices of major central banks (especially the US Fed) far beyond their formal juridictions => major source of actual volatility in capital flows, export of inflation or deflation
  - Others must follow decisions of major players (dealing with 'external' shocks produced by their decisions)

## ***2. EMEs and international financial institution***
> Bretton Woods intitutions
  - International Monetary Fund(IMF)
  - The World Bank(WB)
  - World Trade Organization(WTO)

  - 1972-1981 exit from Bretton Woods system, dealing with oil shocks, helping poor countries
  - 1982-1989 EME debt crisis and post-crisis adjustment
  - 1990-2004 market transition (especially in CEE and CIS), emerging-market crises
  - Since 2005 globalization and consequences of global financial crisis

## ***3. EMEs and global trade***
> EME in global trade
  - Faster growth of exports as compared to advanced economics => growing share in world trade
  ![Volume of exports of goods and services % change](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/148195631-7db093f1-3bec-4264-a183-7cc7db0d4bd1.png)
  - But still lower than their share in GDP
  ![Share of EME regions in world's economy % 2013](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/148195788-23d12de1-7db3-4e6e-99f2-8551f218acd7.png)
  - Except CEE, CIS and MENA
  
> ![Share of Large EME in world's economy % 2013](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/148196416-546fbaaf-50ed-49a0-abcb-a41e1ebaad4f.PNG)
  This is even better seen in case of largest EME(e.g. BRICS)
  
> ![Trade openness (exports plus imports_percent of GDP)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/148196584-9530c0fc-e7b5-45f2-9aa5-769778691002.PNG)
  Partly this function of country's size but not only

> Factors of EME's  under-trading
  - Lower level of development
  - Trade protectionism in EME
  - Trade protectionism in advanced economies(in agriculture and services)
  - Commodity monoculture
