# [Week 4. Market reforms in the Arab world, Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#economics-of-transition-and-emerging-markets)
## ***1. Background of Arab transition***
> Geographical coverage
  - Arab republican regimes that emerged(1950s-1960s), as a result of military coups or anti-colonial resistance and considered themselves as "socialist": Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Syria, Iraq and Algeria
  - Jordan, Lebanon and Morocco do not represent "socialist" past but some similar features.

> Similarities between Arab socialism and Soviet-type socialism - politics
  - Dictatorship/hegemony of one political party(lack of democracy and political pluralism)
  - Manipulated election processes
  - Political dependence of the judiciary
  - The excessive power of the army, security agencies and police
  - Censorship, tight administrative contron of grass-roots citizen initiatives 
  - Massive violations of human rights; organised repression of certain social, political, ethnic or sectarian groups
  - However, similar characteristics of the authoritarian regimes in other groups(Asia, Africa, Latin America); communism was not unique in this respect

> Similarties between Arab socialism and Soviet-type socialism - economy
  - Dominance of politicis and ideology over economic criteria
  - Price controls, subsidies, price distortions(especially food and energy)
  - Key role of public ownership, political/party/military/security nominations for managerial positions
  - Autarky, import-substitution industrialization, protectionism
  - Burden of military.security spending
  - Social emplyment in public sector
  - Some of these characteristics present in non-socialist Arab countries

> Where Arab "socialist" economies differed from Soviet-type economies)
  - Greater role of private sector(agriculture, trade, services, small and medium size manufacturing)
  - Private ownership never condemned and amrket institutions/legal infrastructure largely in place
  - Less distorted prices, less acute shortage of basic goods
  - Higher income and wealth inequalities
  - Less acute macroeconomic disequilibria
  - Less over-industrialization and less structural distortions
  - More economic openness and more contacts with the West(economic relations, education, personal contacts)

> Arab reforms since 1980s - triggers
  - Sharp declines in oil prices in mid-1980s
  - End of Soviet support(end of 1980s)
  - Reforms in CEE/FSU, China, India and other developing countries
  - Pressure of the IFIs, US, EU etc.
  - Ineffectiveness of the previous model
  - Interest of elites to enrich themselves
  - Seeking macroeconomic and social stability

> Arab reforms since 1980s
