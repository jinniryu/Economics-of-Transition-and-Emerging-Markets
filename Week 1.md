# [Week 1. Centrally planned economy its origins, evolution and collapse](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#economics-of-transition-and-emerging-markets)
## ***1. Origins of Centrally Planned Economy and its major characteristic***
> Theoretical/idelogical foundations of a centrally planned economy(CPE)
  - Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenini's visions of a society without exploitation(associated with market forces and private ownership of means of production)
  - Because of the idelogical/political context, frequently called as communist/socialist/command economy
  
> Basic characteristics according to a communist/socialist doctrine
  - Rejecting private ownership of means of production => state or collective ownership(with minor exceptions)
  - Rejecting market coordination => central planning
  - Lenin : National economy as the single factory, vertically managed
  - Some other proposals never implemented(because of their utopian character)
    - individual consumtion according to 'needs'
    - Non-monetary economy
    
> Historical context of its implementation
  - Post-revolutionary Russia in the conditions of civil war and international isolation
  - Failure of the dream of worldwide revolution => necessity to 'build socialism in the single isolated country'
  - Russia's unfinished industrialization(mythology of the leading role of industrial working class)
  - Military needs
  
> Stages of implementation
  - The first attepmt('war communism' of 1918-1921) ; failed(famine, massive resistance of peasants)
  - Followed by the New Economic Policy(NEP)
  - The second attempt:Stalinist industrialization and collectivization ; completed at very high economic, social and human costs.
  - Model exported to Central and Eastern Europe and part of Asia after WW2
  
> CPE in its Stalinist version
  - The dominant role of central plan: production targets, allocation of inputs(including labor), investment decisions, secondary role of prices, financial flows and budget constraints
  - Administrative determination of prices and wages
  - State monopoly of foreign trade, lack of currency convertibility, multiple exchange rates, isolation from world markets, autarky
  - Forced industrialization(heavy and military industry) at the cost of other sectors
  
> Stalinist model: political and human dimension
  - Political totalitarianism(hegemony of communist party, restriction on political and civic freedoms, political terror)
  - The excessive power of the army, security agencies and police
  - Massive use of forced labor('Gulag' system)
  - Famine caused by collapse of private agriculture
  - Debatable economic results of the Soviet economy
  
> Effects of CPE model
  - Perverse microeconomic incentives connected with planning bargain: demand for lower production targets and higher input allocation; 'soft' budget constraints(Janos Kornai)
  - Price distortions and market shortages, rationing of consumer goods and productions inputs(shortage economy as of Janos Kornai)
  - Autarky, import-substitution industrialization, lack of international competitiveness, structural distortions
  - Political nominations for managerial positions

## ***2. Attempts to reform CPE***
> Early controversy over the efficiency of 'Socialist' model
  - Boris Brutskus and Ludwig Von Mises questioned efficiency of CPE in early 1920s, followed by Friedrich A. Hayek in 1930s and 1940s
  - Oskar Lange(1937) definded rationale of 'socialist' economy but not its actual form(Stalinist model) but the proposed sort of decentralized model - polemics with Von Mises('Socialist calculation debate')
  
> How to reform socialist economy? (1)
  - Idea: **relationalization of central planning** and its instruments using mathematical models of optimal planning and shadow prices(Oskar Lange, Leonid Kantorovich, Victor Novozhilov)
  - Problems: it disregarded information barriers(plan bargaining) and politicization of government price decisions
  
> How to reform socialist economy? (2)
  - Idea: **democoratization of central planning**(Woldzimierz Brus)
  - Problems: it contradicted political nature of both communist totalitarianism and democracy(democracy cannot exist without market and private property)
  
> How to reform socialist economy? (3)
  - Idea: **market socialism**, i.e., market mechanism without private ownership(Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Oskar Lange, Fred M. Taylor, Jaroslav Vanek, Branko Horvath, Wlodzimierz Brus)
  - Problems: Who is the economic subject/entrepreneur?
  
> Examples of complex reforms
  - Yugoslavia(early 1950s, 1965, 1972)
  - Hungary(1964, continuation in 1980s)
  - Czechoslovakia(1964-1969)?
  - Poland(1982)?
  
> Examples of partial reforms
  - Poland(1957-1959, 1972-1974)
  - Bulgaria(mid 1960s)
  - USSR(1964, period of perestroika)
  
> Problems of market socialism
  - How to protect economic autonomy of 'socialist' enterprise? The role of employee self-management
  - Goal function of a 'socialist' enterprise: profit or income/value added per 1 employee? Consequences for allocation of labor and capital
  - Macroeconomic disequilibrium originating from administrative price formation and weak macroeconomic policies
  - Imperfect property rights => negative impact on investment decisions, economic responsibility, soft budget constraints(Kornai) and market exit
  - Limits to private sector and foreign capital => weak market competition and innovations, only limited opening of an ecomony to external world(trade and labor flows but not capital)
  
> Lessons of 'socialist' reforms
  - Partial and slow reforms do not work: problem of 'critical mass' of reforms
  - Some political reforms needed for success of economic reforms(conflict between political monopoly of communist party and enterprise autonomy)
  - Key role of price liberalization, external openness and macroeconomic equilibrium at the early stage of reform.
  - The key role of rapid and mass privatization. Nevertherless, remnants of 'market socialism'(autonomous state enterprise) will continue exist in the transition period
  - Employees ownership can work only temporarily as the transition stage to unrestricted private ownership
  - Most of theoretical models of 'socialist reforms' proved impractical during market(post-communist) transition

## ***3. Collapse of the CPE***
> Changes in CPE after Stalin death
  - Less repressions
  - Greater focus on consumtion and social protection
  - Agriculture: from resource drain to subsidization
  - Pragmatic compromises(small land plots in Soviet Union, de-collectivization in Poland)

> Economic deterioration in the USSR and other CPEs in 1980s
  - Limits of 'extensive' growth
  - Decline in oil prices since 1985(USSR)
  - High costs of arm race
  - Political weakening of communist regimes
    - Social concessions(to retain legitimacy)
    - Loosing control over managers
    - Partial and chaotic economic reforms

> Effects of Chaotic reforms
  - Price arbitrage(income stripping) => building oligarchic fortunes
  - 'Nomenclature' privatization(assets stripping)
  - Collapse of planning discipline and coordination => systemic vacuum and unmanageability
  - Collapse of fiscal and monetary discipline => balance-of-payment crisis

> Sources of Macroeconomic Disequilibrium
  - Price control => market shortages => forced savings => monetary overhang(hidden [hyper] inflation)
  - Price control => subsidies to basic goods => budget deficit => money printing
  - Decrease of oil prices(former USSR)
  - Social populism of later communism
  - Long public debate about price liberalization

## ***4. Transition agenda***
> Transition in CEE/FSU
  - Macroeconomic stabilization
  - Domestic and external liberalization
  - Privatization and enterprise restructuring
  - Institutional and legal reform
  - Building a market-based social safety net
  - Political reform

> Macroeconomic stabilization
  - Fiscal adjustment (reducing subsidies [price liberalization] and government investment spending, market-based tax reform, creating room for SSN)
  - Stopping quasi-fiscal activities of central bank
  - Limiting credit expansion, active role of central bank, central bank independence, market-based monetary policy instruments
  - Temporary wage control in some countries

> Liberalization
  - Price deregulation, removing subsidies
  - Unification of exchange rate, current account convertibility, then capital account convertibility
  - Free private entrepreneurship, business deregulation
  - Trade liberalization(unilateral then followed by AA with the EU and EU/WTO accession)
  - Dismantling monobank, opening door for private and foreign banks, abolishing interest rate control

> Privatization and enterprise restructuring
  - Limited results of enterprise restructuring without privatization
  - Corporatization works only as the intermediate stage to privatization
  - The role of hard budget constraints and competition
  - Experience with various privatization schemes (IPOI, sales to strategic investor, voucher privatization, employee/management buy-out, debt-equity swap, joint-ventures)

> Institutional and legal reform
  - Building of various kind of market-support institutions and adopting market-oriented legislation
  - Crucial role of independent, professionally competent and uncorrupted judiciary as well as civil service
  - Helpful role of EU AA and EU accession(second-generation reforms)

> Social safety net
  - Moving from subsidies, benefits in-kind, labor safety and enterprise-based SSN to targeted SSN
  - Better targeting (political and institutional constraints)
  - Unemployment benefits and ALMP
  - Building a multi-pillar pension system
  - Demographic challenges (pension system & health care)
  - Mixed results of SSN ("premature post-communist welfare state")

## ***5. Challenges of stabilization and disinflation***
> Slow pace of disinflation
  - Legacy of the late communist/ early transition period(inertia)
  - Lax monetary policy (often dependent on political decisions)
  - Fiscal imbalances

> ![End-of-year inflation in transition economies 1991-2001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147812275-d70c8303-7abf-427b-b5e4-8ea1b21499a2.PNG)

> Hytperinflation episodes
  - Yugoslavia(310,000,000% monthly in January 1994)
  - Georgia(50,654% 12-months inflation in September 1994)
  - Armenia(29,600.9% 12-months inflation in May 1994)
  - Ukraine(10,155% 12-months inflation in December 1993)

![Cumulative inflation 1996-2001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147812421-28e74d64-d70c-4448-8f2f-55f0ade1fd0f.PNG)

> Stabilization strategies
  - Orthodox
    - Money based
    - Exchange-rate based
The crucial role of exchange rate stability(de facto) in bringing inflation down => the case of Balkan, Baltic and Caucasus countries

> Countries with Crawling peg / crawling band regimes / targeting real exchange rate
  - Poland (1991-2000)
  - Hungary(199502991)
  - Russia(1995-1998 and 2001-2002)
  - Slovenia

> What are the problems with the crawling peg/band regimes?
  - Building up strong inflationary inertia
  - Political resistance to slow down rate of crawl (export promotion target gets de facto priority)
  - Inability to target real exchange rate in the world of free capital mobility

> Monetary financing of a fiscal deficit

Fiscal deficit => Growth in monetary base => Growth in money supply => Inflation

> Domestic non-monetary financing

Fiscal deficit => Growing public debt under conditions of limited monetization and underdevelopment of financial market => Increasing yields of Treasury bills => Increasing interest payments => Further increase of fiscal deficit; expectation of default => Difficulties with rolling over Treasury bills => Return to monetary financing of fiscal deficit => Growth in monetary base => Growth in money supply => Inflation
  
> External private financing

Fiscal deficit => Increase in short term external debt in relation to GDP, export, foreign exchange reserves, budget revenue => Decreasing country credibility => Capital outflow => Difficulties with rolling over public debt + Decreasing foreign exchange reserves => Return to monetary financing of a fiscal deficit + change in composition of a moentary base => Speculative attack => Devaluation => Inflation

> Examples of disinflation trend reversal

## ***6. Privatization***
> Starting point of transition
  - Close to monopoly of state and cooperative/collective ownership in Czechoslovakia, USSR, Romania, Bulgaria
  - Some limited enclaves of private ownership in Poland(>20%), Yugoslavia, Hungary, GDR
  - Perestroika in the USSR: cooperatives, private leasing
  - Limited participation of foreign firms allowed only in Hungary, Yugoslavia and Poland

> Rebuilding private ownership
  - Creation of new domestic private firms
  - Green-filed FDI
  - Restitution of old private property rights
  - Privatization of housing
  - Privatization of land(political barriers in may CIS countries)
  - Privatization of state owned firms

> New private firms
  - Elimination of regulatory barriers
  - Tax incentives
  - Access to credit
  - Small-scale privatization

> Re-privatization / restitution
  - All CEE and Baltic except Polland(where only limited and delayed)
  - Physical restitution - mainly housing, land and small-scale production assets
  - Compensation in other cases
  - Several legal, political, technical and financial obstacles

> Large-scale privatization
  - Initial private offering
  - Selling to strategic investor (domestic or foreign)
  - Joint ventures with foreign firms
  - Employee and management buy-out(leveraged)
  - Voucher/coupon privatization, including voucher/coupon funds
  - Debt-to-equity swap
  - 'Liquidation' privatization

> Privatization dilemmas
  - Lack of stock exchange and few strategic investors in early stages of transition
  - Employee and voucher privatization slowed enterprise restructuring
  - Importance of hard budget constraints and macroeconomic stability
  - Political compromises and goals(building support for reform, 'peoples' capitalism, etc.)
  - Any privatization was better than no privatization

> Privatization outcomes
  - More than 50% of GDP contributed by a private sector in all countries but Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Belarus
  - Several pockets of state ownership remains(maily infrastructure and industries considered as 'strategic')
  - Renationalization drift in Russia
