# [Week 3. The role of external actors in post-communist transition and economic reforms in Aisa](https://github.com/jinniryu/Economics-of-Transition-and-Emerging-Markets/blob/main/README.md#economics-of-transition-and-emerging-markets)
## ***1. Transition countries and the EU***
> EU accession of less developed countries
  - Mediterranean Enlargement of 1980s(Greece, Portugal and Spain)
  - Eastern Enlargement 2004, 2007, 2013(Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Rep., Cyprus, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia)

> Eu Candidates
  - Negotiating(Turkey, Montenegro, Serbia)
  - Waiting for Negotiation (Macedonia)
  - Potential(Albania, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Kosovo)

> ![Timetable of EU intergration process of post-communist countries](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147862300-2c6dc62d-5eaa-440e-9119-e18d652f9ebe.PNG)

> Stages of accession process (1)
  - Stabilization and association Agreement
  - Membership application
  - Obtaining the EU Candidate status
  - Opening membership negotiations(35 chapters)
  - Concluding memebership negotiation

> Copenhagen Criteria for EU Accession
  - Stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and repect for and protection of minorities
  - The existence of a functioning market economy, as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union
  - Ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union

> Stages of accession process (2)
  - Signing an accession treaty
  - Ratification of accession treaty and entering the EU
  - Post-accession monitoring(Cooperation and Verification Mechanism)
  - Post-accession transitory periods, Schengen accession, EMU accession

> More difficult conditions of next EU enlargements
  - Post-enlargement fatigure(in OMS and NMS)
  - Economic crisis in the EU
  - Most candidates represent low GDP per capita level
  - Post-conflict situation in Western Balkans
  - No more 'wholesales' enlargements(like 2004 one)
  - Weaker carrot & stronger stick: less chances for waivers
  - Danger of anti-accession backlash (example of Turkey)

> EU Eastern Partnetship Offer
  - Association Agreement
  - Deep and Comprehensive FTA
  - Visa facilitation => Visa liberalization
  - Comprehensive Institution-Building Programs
  - Central Asia excluded

## ***2. Transition countries in early 2010s***
> End of transition?(1)
  - Basic transition agenda completed in early 2000s: the largest, fastest and most complex reform episode in contemporary economic history (ca. 15 years)?
  - In most former communist countries market mechanism coordinates most of productions and investment decisions
  - Private sector contributes between 60%and 80% of GDP(EBRD, 2010). Eceptions: Turkmenistan(25%), Belarus(30%), Uzbekistan(45% of private sector in GDP) + North Korea and Cuba

> End of transition?(2)
  - Openness to international trade
  - Various level of market distortions and various quality of governance
  - Decade of 2000s: rapid economic growth, low or morderate inflation, remonetization, high international reserves, improvement of fiscal balances; but part of these achievements reversed ni 2008-2010

> Relative weight
  - Russia: 3% of world GDP in 2010; comparing to China(13.6%)m India(5.5%), Brazil(2.9%)
  - EU NMS contributed to 5.4% of GDP of EU27 in 2004 and to 7.4% in 2010; Poland: 2.9% of EU27 GPD in 2010, Czech Republic (1.2%), Romania(1%)

> Challenges and problems ahead
  - Post-crisis environment: slower and more fragile growth, higher debts, volatile commodity markets, inflation pressures
  - How to improve business climate and governance (CIS and Western Balkans)?
  - How to avoid marginalization in global economy(CIS, Central Asia)
  - Unsustainable welfare state(NMS, Western Balkans, Western CIS)

## ***3. Specifics of Chinese transition***
> Wrong comparisions
  - In 1990s numerous suggestions that CEE/FSU could follow Chinese experience to avoid transition-related output decline(part of the transition-controversy debate) - eg. Rawski or Stiglitz
  - Apart from wrong interpretation of facts(e.g. Russian 'shock therapy' vs Chinese 'gradualism'), disregard for differences in starting conditions.

> Three differences in starting conditions
  - Level of economic development and industrialization
  - Social policy and social services
  - Political environment

> Level of economic development
  - At the starting point of market transition(1989-1991) CEE/FSU had GDP PPP per capita level 20-50 times higher than China in 1980
  ![Original GNI per capita, PPP_current international $](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88122687/147871838-8503626b-e287-40e7-b0e7-a832e993b19f.png)

> Structural characteristics
  - State owned industry was non-competitive in both cases but China was under-industrialized and CEE/FSU over-industrialized, with high share of military industry
  - Labor surplus in China vs. Labor shortage in CEE/FUS
  - Ineffective and 'industrialized' agriculture in CEE/FSU: Level of structural distortions in CEE/FSU much higher than in China(e.g. higher energy intensity)

> Share of military expenditure in GDP in %(1989)
  - China 2.7
  - Hungary 3.1
  - Poland 1.9
  - Romania 4.8
  - Russia 17.5

> Differences on a social front
  - In China only public sector employees covered by publicly financed pension system and other social policy instruments(ca. 20% of pupulation)
  - In CEE/FSU excessive burden of social programs(legitimization attempt of late communist regimes)- share in GDP close to that in Western Europe
  - Higher level of social services(health, education, etc) provision in CEE/FSU comparing to China

> Diffrences on political front
  - At the late stage of communism governments in CEE/FSU unable to use coercive power on massive scale => inability to continue selectively elements of command system (opposite situation in China)
  - Finally spontaneous collapse of the centrally planned economy in CEE/FSU
  - Demand for democratization in CEE/ part of FSU

> Consequences for transition strategies
  - CEE/FSU had to de-industrialize in order to create room for market-oriented restructuring. China had free resources (surplus labor in agriculture) - analogy with NEP in USSR in 1920s
  - Easy way of privatizing agriculture in China and starting new private/ quasi-private sector outside agriculture
  - Necessity to reduce social spending in CEE/FSU in order to secure macroeconomic stability
  - Building market economy under authoritarian regime was not the option for most CEE/FSU countries in late 1980s/early 1990s wile it was the option for China
  - 'Gradualism' less promising in CEE/FSU because of government inability of 'fine tuning' (sometimes even problems with providing basic public goods); in addition, disappointing  experience with 'market socialism' reforms before

## ***4. Main stages of Chinese transition***
> Economic history before Mao
  - Until early 19th century the largest world economy (>30% of world GDP) with GDP per capita level at world's average even if Chinese economy stagnated since 16th century
  - Most of 19th and 20th centuries - stagnation or decline caused by political developments(short period of fster growth in 1920s and early 1930s)

> Economic model of Mao Zedong
  - Soviet-type central planning system
  - Collectivization of agriculture - People's communes => famine
  - Forceful industrialization of Stalinist type - 'The Great Leap Forward'(1958-1959) => collapse of the economy
  - Cultural revolution of 1966-1969(1971)

> Stages of Chinese reforms
  - 1978-1984(Deng Xiaoping): de-collectivization of agriculture (the 'household responsibility system'), dual price system in urban industry, special economic zones(FDI), private enterprises allowed
  - 1984-1993(Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang): decentralization (=> regional experiments), township and village enterprises, reopening Shanghai Stock Exchange; but also suppression of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989
  - 1993-2005(Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji): unifying exchange rate and current account convertibility, trade liberalization, joining the WTO, Large-scale privatization, financial sector reform
  - Since 2005(Hu Jintao): reform stagnation, more subsidies, lax monetary policy leading to credit and real-estate bubbble, public investment boom, increasing international controversies over underappreciated exchage rate

> Common features of Chinese policies
  - Export-led growth strategy based on low-cost labor, underappreciated exchage rate and FDI
  - Strong focus on macroeconomic equilibria
  - Limited role of social programs

> Controversy around Chinese 'gradualism'
  - The initial reform(de-collectivization) was radical
  - The subsequent gradualism resulted from political resistance within communist party apparatus rather then a priori choice
  - China has room for gradualist reforms unlike CEE/CIS
  - Costs of gradualism(income inequality and regional disparities)

> Result of Chinese reforms
  - Very high growth rate - ca. 10% annually, on average
  - Second largest economy inthe world(after the US) but less than 12% of US GDP per capita at current prices and 17.5% in PPP terms
  - The largest world creditor
  - The largest world manufacturing exporter
  - More than 70% of GDP contributed by private or quasi-private sector
  - But property rights not fully transparent
  - Reduction of poverty
  - But increase in inequality(Gini coefficient > 0.45)
  - Relative macroeconomic stability(as for emerging markets standards)

> Challenges ahead
  - Elements of financial crisis
  - Forthcoming demographic crisis
  - Limits of 'extensive' growth and export-led growth
  - Ecological, social and urbanization barriers
  - Need for new reform round and change in growth strategy

## ***5. Economic transition in other Asian countries***
> Following Chinese experience
  - Vietnam since 1986(Doi Moi reforms)
  - Laos since 1986(The New Economic Mechanisms)
  - Cambodia since 1985
  - Myanmar(Burma) since 2011
  - The helpful role of ASEAN integration

> Political and economic reforms in Mongolia
  - Economically and politically closer to USSR than China
  - Communist regime and CPE until 1990
  - Soviet aid - up to 1/3 Mongolian GDP => huge debt(300-700% of GDP depending on exchange rate of transfer ruble)
  - Soviet-type industrialization => structural distortions
  - Successful political transition to multi-party democracy
  - Fast market reforms of early 1990s
  - Rapid growth based on commodity boom(copper, gold and other non-ferrous metals)

> Background of economic reforms in India
  - The largest democracy in the world based on the British legal system, federal state
  - But until 1991 economy policy was based on a sort of Socialist ideoloty(Fabian socialism) and import-subsititution strategy
  - Two unsuccessful attempts of reforms(1966-1967 and 1985-1987)
  - Growth(average 3.5%, per capita 1%) slower as compared to neighbors

> Economic system in India before 1991
  - Predominantly private economy but with large share of public ownership(industry, infrastructure, banks)
  - Currency inconvertibility
  - Strong trade protectionism
  - Internal overregulation('License Raj')
  - Role of indicative central planning
  - Large agriculture subsidies
  - Financial repression

> Triggers of economic reforms in India
  - Balance-of-payment crisis in 1991
  - IMF program
  - More generally:geopolitical competition with China and Pakistan
  - Government of Narasimaba Rao and Manmohan Singh

> Economic reform in India in 1991
  - Current account convertibility
  - Partial trade openness
  - Partial internal deregulation
  - Breaking up state monopolies
  - Reducing subsidies, fiscal adjustment
  - Privatization
  - Disinflation

> India's challenges
  - High growth(7-9%) but slower than China, especially in per capita terms
  - Remaining large pockets of poverty
  - High income inequality
  - Health and education challenges
  - Corruption
  - Remaining 'red' tape
  - Limits on FDI
  - Remaining trade protectionism(especially agriculture)
  - Macroeconomic fragilities(near currency crisis in 2013)
  - Reform stagnation after 2007
